# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:  Object destructuring is breaking up the stored data items to seperate and make accessible the values held within an object.

  Researched answer: Object Destructuring is a little bit of syntactic sugar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) that can be used to bind the properties of an object to a variable. Sometimes working with JavaScript objects can become repetitive in the sense that you need to write out the object name followed by the property name like so: objectName.propertyName. Using object destructuring, you can simply use propertyName to achieve the same result.

2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer: Arrays, objects, and variables

  Researched answer:  Rest parameters, default parameters or destructured parameters



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class definition can be passed / inherited. An object does not have this ability.

  Researched answer: Technically there are no classe in JavaScript. A class is a definition of an object with a constructor function.


4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?
 
  Your answer: A div is container and a span is a cover.

  Researched answer: In standard HTML, a div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline element. The div block visually isolates a section of a document on the page, and may contain other block-level components. The span element contains a piece of information inline with the surrounding content, and may only contain other inline-level components.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?
  
  Your answer: <> </> it will save you some code.
  
  Researched answer: React Fragment is a react component which helps us to return the multiple child elements without using the extra dom nodes. It saves you from creating divs in child elements.

6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Using Bootstrap, using another library, hand coding how to display pages at different screen resolutions

  Researched answer: Foundation (https://get.foundation/), Bootstrap, 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming

Isn't this what we are already doing with JavaScript?  React is said to be declarative programming though. I like this explaination of OOP.

- irb
 
Interactive Ruby Shell ( IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb is a portmanteau of the word "interactive" and the filename extension for Ruby files, ".rb"

- Instance variable

In the Ruby programming language, an instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol. An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data.

- Ruby hash

A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type.

- Class relationships

Three important relationships in Ruby are known as ‘belongs to…’, ‘has many…’, and “has many of each other”. The ‘belongs to’ and ‘has many’ relationships are considered to be the inverse of one another.
